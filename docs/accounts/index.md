# Accounts & Passwords

- A password manager, such as [1Password][] should be used for secure password
  generation and sharing. As such, generated passwords should be reasonably
  secure in relation to the password requirements of the platform.
- Where possible, [Single Sign-On][] should be used to authenticate internal
  users and reduce the number of places where passwords need creation.
- [Passkeys][] and/or MFA processes should be enforced where possible, and
  otherwise strongly encouraged.
